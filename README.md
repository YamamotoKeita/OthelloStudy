# OthelloStudy
An Othello program to try out the Rust.


# TODO
- ✅ Make a simple AI that is not that strong
- ✅ Make simple CUI
- Make GUI
- Have a database of standard movements in the early stages
- Evaluate the board using stones pattern evaluation values computed by machine learning
- Apply move ordering to pruning
- Make NegaScout algorithm
- Limit the search time
- Optimize evaluation parameters using machine learning
- Optimize search and move ordering for final stages
- Make node search multi-thread
- Make optimized and fast hashmap
- Apply multi prob cut to search algorithm
- Store board evaluations into transposition table
- Optimize search algorithm by turn number and search depth
- Fight the strongest AI and collect data
- Find some new way to beat existing strongest AI
